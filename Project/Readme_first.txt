This code performs several tasks:

It imports necessary libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for data visualization, and NumPy for numerical operations.

It reads a CSV file named "economic_index.csv" into a DataFrame called df_index using Pandas.

It drops unnecessary columns ("Unnamed: 0", "year", "month") from the DataFrame using the drop() method.

It checks for any missing values in the DataFrame using the isnull() method and sums them up.

It visualizes the data by creating a pair plot using Seaborn, which shows pairwise relationships and distributions between the columns.

It calculates the correlation matrix between columns in the DataFrame using Seaborn's pairplot() function.

It fits a linear regression model to predict the "index_price" based on the "interest_rate" and "unemployment_rate" using scikit-learn's LinearRegression().

It prints the coefficients of the linear regression model, as well as the R-squared value, which indicates how well the model fits the data.

It displays the scatter plot of the actual vs. predicted values of the "index_price" using Matplotlib.

Finally, it displays the summary statistics of the linear regression model using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, including coefficients, standard errors, t-values, p-values, and confidence intervals.

In simple terms, this code reads economic data from a CSV file, cleans it by removing unnecessary columns, checks for missing values, visualizes the relationships between different economic factors, builds a linear regression model to predict index prices based on interest rates and unemployment rates, and then evaluates the performance of the model.
